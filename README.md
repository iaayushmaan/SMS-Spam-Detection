# SMS-Spam-Detection

In this repository, we have used the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to detect spam messages, the reason for using this classifier is the simple implementation, high accuracy, and vector implementation method of this model. It should be noted that other methods can also be used to detect spam messages, such as the Complement Naive Bayes classifier and Tf-Idf.
